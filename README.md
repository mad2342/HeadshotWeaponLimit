# Headshot Weapon Limit

[Battletech Mod][ModTek] Headshots against moving targets may only involve one weapon by default. Some new traits of the gunnery skill raise that limit.

## Gameplay changes
* Precision Strike Headshots are only possible with a limited amount of weapons
    * It's just not possible to align all weapons sitting in multiple locations to target the head of a moving target
    * This does not alter the behaviour/ruleset for called shots against prone/shutdown targets
* Weapon limit is 1 by default and is raised through progression in the gunnery skilltree
    * To a maximum of 4
* Will make a "Alphastrike vs. Headshot" decision matter
